    <h2>Censorship in Call of Duty</h2>
    <p>
       <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty_(series)">Call of Duty</a></span> is a popular and well-known videogame played by millions of people in multiple countries around the world. 
       The game has grown extremely popular and is one of the most well-known shooter games we have ever seen. 
       However, with this on-going popularity, the game has had its flaws as well in terms of censorship issues, including hate speech, toxic activity, racism, and other foul language. 
       Because of these issues, Call of Duty has implemented AI assistance to combat the problem. 
       In this article, we will take a deeper dive into the world of AI and how we can use it to success fully implement censorship in videogames.

    <h2>ToxMod</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://www.modulate.ai/toxmod/gaming">ToxMod</a></span> is a tool Activision (creators of Call of Duty) has been testing in America and has implemented into the servers of Call of Duty to combat hateful speech. 
      Toxmod can "identify in real-time and enforce against toxic speech—including hate speech, discriminatory language, harassment, and more." (PcGamer). 
      The tool detects foul language and reports it to the system. 
      While Toxmod does not have the ability to ban players from voice chats, it can report infractions, which may eventually lead to players being removed after multiple violations.<br><br>
      The tool has been tested for numerous hateful activities while not only flagging hate speech but also various sorts of harmful activities. 
      Toxmod has been tested for months to pick up on foul activities such as potential acts of “terms and phrases relating to white supremacist groups, radicalization, and extremism—in real-time." (PcGamer). 
      Some of the aspects ToxMod claims to address include the promotion or sharing of hateful ideology, recruitment into hate groups, targeting vulnerable individuals, and planning physical violence

    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>Call of Duty has always stood by its values of maintaining hate-free and safe servers, as both kids and adults play the game. 
      ToxMod acts as a “middleman” in this context, serving as a detective tool to flag key words, phrases, and suspicious activities by listening to server interactions for hours to determine whether or not certain players should have the privilege of voice chat access.
    </p>
    <h2>Keeping the Servers Safe</h2>
    <p>As the videogame industry continues to grow, it is vital to keep servers safe and free from harmful content. 
       AI plays a crucial role in this endeavor, especially with the ongoing development and integration of tools like ToxMod. 
       With ToxMod, the goal is to maintain as clean and respectful an environment as possible within Call of Duty's online community</p>
