    <h2>Understanding Censorship</h2>
    <div id="articlecontainer">
      <article class="about">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_censorship"><strong>Censorship</strong></a> in video games involves the effort of limiting access to certain elements 
        of a game or limiting a game all together by blocking it in specific countries. 
        These limitations range from <i>protections of younger audiences, and in other countries, anything that applies a 
        negative conotation on their government</i>. This idea is further expanded upon with the <strong><a href="https://steemit.com/humor/@ryangtanaka/ersb-ratings-overhaul">ratings system</a>
        </strong>
        brought on by the ERSB. Click the bold text to learn more!

    <h2>The Effects & Conversations of Censorship</h2>
    <div id="articlecontainer">
      <article class="about">
        Video game censorship tends to bring up multiple conversations, both leaning on opposite sides with one side advocating for it, and one side
        against it. On the side advocating for these censorship opportunities, there are articles like <strong>
          <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/violent-video-games-and-young-people.">Violent Video Games and Young People</a>
        </strong>
        and <strong>
          <a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Video-Games-Youth-091.aspx?WebsiteKey=a2785385-0ccf-4047-b76a-64b4094ae07f">
            Video Games and Youth
          </a>
        </strong>
        that offer insight on the effects of video games of considerable violence on younger audiences, and steps that parents can take. Then, there are articles such as
        <strong><a href="https://ncac.org/issue/video-games">Video Games</a></strong>, an article written by the <i>National Coalition Against Censorship</i> who argue against
        such censorships. Click the bold text to read more into the aforementioned articles!
