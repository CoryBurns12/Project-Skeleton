        <h2>Physical Games</h2>
        <p>Before games can be released to the public to be put in stores, the games must be reviewed and tested by publishers. 
           There are two main ideas these publishers use when testing these games, those two ideas are:</p>
        <ol>
          <strong>
          <li>A questionnaire that entails any type of relevent content that gives details
              about the game (sex, violence, blood, etc)</li>
            <li>Video of live game action that includes the main content of the game, every mission,
                plot, and scene that may be labeled as explicit or inappropriate.</li>
          </strong>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the video is recorded, it is reviewed by trainers, who recommend things such as the rating, content descriptors, and interactive elements. Their recommendations are then reviewed over again, confirmed, and then the game's final rating is created.</p>
        <h2>Digital Games</h2>
        <p>
          Digital games are rated using a process named "International Age Rating Coalition" (IARC). This system allows developers to monitor rating assignments, test products to ensure they were properly assigned, and adjust the rating if it is needed. Prior to a game's release to the public, the game is reviewed by developers and has a questionnaire filled out that assigns the game's rating, content descriptors, and its interactive elements. Games rated by the IARC process do not have to have rating summaries like physical games.
        </p>

      <h2>Enforcement</h2>
      <p>There are multiple methods ERSP uses in order to properly make sure games are rated correctly and they make sure details are not skipped over. For digitally delivered games/apps that use IARC, ERSP can promptly correct the rating assignment, which serves as an effective enforcement mechanism. However, for physical games, the process is a little more difficult. Physical games are not as easy to modify after a game ships. Because of this, the enforcement system includes a fine (up to 1 million dollars) that could be cast upon publishers who are not transparent with the rating process.</p>
